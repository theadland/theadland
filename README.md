Hey Everyone, I'm  Thomas Headland!

My formost interests in computer science and programming are game engines and computer graphics! 
Video games have been an important fixture for the majority of my life and in recent years I have
been diving into how they work. 

I am currently studying computer science at Oregon State University and expecting to graduate in
2022! In addition to my academic studies, I enjoy learning about and working with the Vulkan
graphics API and programming in C and C++.
